 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The styles given here are suitable for the demos that are used with the standard DataTables
 * distribution (see www.datatables.net). You will most likely wish to modify these styles to
 * meet the layout requirements of your site.
 *
 * Common issues:
 *   'full_numbers' pagination - I use an extra selector on the body tag to ensure that there is
 *     no conflict between the two pagination types. If you want to use full_numbers pagination
 *     ensure that you either have "example_alt_pagination" as a body class name, or better yet,
 *     modify that selector.
 *   Note that the path used for Images is relative. All images are by default located in
 *     ../images/ - relative to this CSS file.
